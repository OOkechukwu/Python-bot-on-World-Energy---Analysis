# Python-bot-on-World-Energy---Analysis
This robot was built to understand the world's historical and current energy trends and electricity mix. The bot also assesses country specific energy and electricity information and has been built flexible to accommodate additional reference points per country and energy scope.

Please note that we have only uploaded energy insight on United Kingdom and Germany at this time. Feel free to prompt the bot on other countries of interest.

The ipynb files contain additional information on the analysis.
